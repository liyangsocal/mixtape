<!-- INTRODUCTION TO LINER NOTES -->
	<!-- <div id="body-text">
		<p>Water flows, flushes, and cycles, constituting the majority of our bodies and planet and making possible all life on Earth. Inspired by the struggle to defend the Pulangi River, Liyang SoCal’s first mixtape called for contributors to respond to water in any and all of its forms and contexts.</p>

		<p>The Pulangi is an extensive river system that supports the livelihood of many rural and indigenous communities as well as cities in Mindanao. The southernmost island of the Philippine archipelago, Mindanao is known for its lush forests and abundance of natural resources which make it the target of large-scale extractive industries around the world. Centuries of resistance left much of Mindanao outside of the reach of colonists that occupied other parts of the Philippine archipelago. Today, the decades-long struggle of communities of Lumad (Indigenous) people and peasants to defend Mindanao’s lands and waters from major damming projects and the plunder and pollution of large-scale agribusiness and mining ventures continues.</p>

		<p>Our support of this struggle is ever-increasingly urgent as the calamitous effects of climate change compound with intense environmental degradation leading to more and more devastating disasters. While the Philippine Government refuses to provide aid to those affected and instead colludes with industries. They fund the militarization of rural and Indigenous communities and target the environmental and human rights defenders whose work is dedicated to exposing the root causes of environmental destruction in the Philippines.</p>

		<p>We’ve dedicated this mixtape to some of these environmental and human rights defenders whose lives were taken in this struggle. On the evening of February 23rd, 2022, Chad Booc, Jurain Ngujo, Elegyn Balonga and their two drivers Robert Aragon and Tirso Añar were massacred by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in New Bataan, Davao de Oro, while returning from a visit to rural communities in southern Mindanao.</p>

		<p>The victims were unarmed civilians who had been active in supporting the Lumad struggle for self-determination. They were deliberately targeted by the AFP because of the far-reaching impact of their service.</p>

		<p>Elegyn was a community health worker who served displaced Lumad communities in UCCP Haran sanctuary, and participated in medical missions serving marginalized rural communities in Mindanao. Her work exposed the unwillingness of the government to meet the needs of its people.</p>

		<p>Chad and Jurain, meanwhile, were volunteer teachers at Lumad schools, both in communities and in evacuation. As Lumad school teachers, Chad and Jurain helped provide scientific and culturally-responsive education, incorporating sustainable agriculture skills and holistic health practices so that their students could go on to help develop and lead their communities.</p>

		<p>Lumad schools were also a key component in communities’ struggles to defend their ancestral lands, in the face of mining, logging and agribusiness interests who had their eye on the resource-rich areas. Jurain and Chad helped empower generations of Lumad youth to assert their rights and take an active part in defending and shaping their communities’ futures.</p>

		<p>Despite not being Lumad themselves, Chad, Jurain and Elegyn all dedicated themselves wholeheartedly to supporting the Lumad cause and struggle.</p>

		<p>Included in a special mix at the end of this tape are excerpts from a song sung by Jurain and Lumad students and a conversation between Liyang and Chad recorded during a webinar in July of 2021. Jurain was a student at a Lumad school before choosing to serve the community by becoming a volunteer teacher himself. The song he and the students sing describes the 2016 Lakbayan ng Pambansang Minorya (People’s Caravan of National Minorities) in which Indigenous peoples from all throughout the Philippines came together in the thousands to call attention to their common struggle to defend their ancestral lands and claim their right to self-determination. Chad taught math at ALCADEV in Lianga, Mindanao after studying Computer Science in college, and was one of the Bakwit 7, who were Lumad students, elders, and volunteer teachers, arrested, held, and later released due to lack of evidence, for three months on fabricated charges in early 2021 because of their advocacy supporting Lumad youth.</p>

		<p>Liyang SoCal joins the call for justice for the New Bataan 5 and dedicates this mixtape to their lives, work, and sacrifice. These heroes understood the supreme importance of the ongoing struggle to defend the land, water, and life in Mindanao as connected to environmental defense and liberation throughout the Philippines and around the world. As we listen, let us consider all the ways we can amplify calls for their justice and an end to exploitation, foreign plunder, and tyranny in Mindanao and around the world.</p>

<!-- LIYANG BIOGRAPHY -->
	<div id="body-text">
		<i>Liyang Network is a local to global advocacy network that amplifies the calls to action of frontline environmental and human rights defenders in Mindanao, Philippines. Originally founded in 2019 in UCCP Haran evacuation center Mindanao, it was born out of a direct request from our primary community partner, Sabokahan Unity of Lumad Women to form a network to bring together all of their international supporters in order to uplift and advocate for the calls of the Lumad people. Since then, we have established an overseas chapter in the US, which mobilizes people nationally in support of the calls of communities in Mindanao. Liyang U.S.A. currently has 3 regional organizing committees which focus on making connections with local issues in Northern California, Southern California, and Western Massachusetts; we also have members across the country and internationally. Since our founding, Liyang has expanded our advocacy work to include peasants and agri-workers in Mindanao, in addition to our work supporting Lumad communities.</i>

    The track is both about a grasshopper that dies out in the grassy fields and transitions into an eternal blade of grass. Simultaneously, the lyrics explore the death of an elder in the community and their transition into the ancestral realm. We see that both are one-in-the-same, grasshopper and elder, as they have much to teach us albeit in different ways, and both ultimately join the eternal realm all the same.

    <b>Lyrics:</b><br>
    This porch I'm on right now is all mine<br>
    And I'm filled with cherry smoke<br>
    Adorned in ash and completely incoherent<br>
    Yeah, its just like how I dreamed it.<br>
    <br>
    And all I want is a field of grass.<br>
    So high, that nobody could pass.<br>
    And the sun's so low, that I pay taxes on it.<br>
    But live like I don't want it.<br>
    <br>
    Cause I don't need to tell everyone, everything.<br>
    Sometimes, sometimes...<br>
    My mouth gets a little untied.<br>
    (Sometimes...)<br>
    <br>
    Right now this porch I'm on is all mine.<br>
    My friends inside the deep deep heat.<br>
    Can these structures ever unwind?<br>
    Their holding everything all the time...<br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, this porch is all mine<br>
    Sometimes, it belongs to you...<br>

    As we attempt to liberate food, we learn that supermarkets are developing facial recognition and license plate software to track your location and identity. When you verify for unemployment, the UI app requires a face scan. At airports, they use biometric data to scan your face instead of a passport. When testing for COVID-19, BioThermal imaging scans your face to read your temperature and heart rate. Instagram starts showing advertisements about a product discussed in our verbal conversations. During protests, drones and cameras scan freedom fighters to redtag, arrest, and murder us off. BIOME(TRICS) highlights the survival and resistance of QTBIPOC (Queer Trans Black Indigenous People of Color) farmers, artists, freedom fighters, organizers, cultural workers, and teachers who combine the digital, spiritual, emotional, and physical to build new worlds, untouched by the surveillance state.<br>

There is no such thing as art for art’s sake in our world currently and so I use my skills and art to help provoke listeners into asking these tough questions about our society.

    <b>Lyrics:</b><br>
    Killing kids abroad by the orders of a fascist<br>
    Those with the money think it's fantastic<br>
    People like me and people like you<br>
    Run from bombs like its a normal thing to do<br>
    The war is at home and the enemy is poverty<br>
    They say, “It’s a part of good ‘ol US Democracy”<br>
    Millions die every day from a broken system<br>
    While the rulers laugh at their fallen kingdom<br>
    <br>
    Fight to overpower<br>
    Fight to survive<br>
    Fight for a better world<br>
    End the capitalist suicide<br>
    <br>
    Workers fighting for their rights at home<br>
    Get crushed under the weight of a pig’s boot<br>
    People like me and people like you<br>
    Just wanting some basic human decency<br>
    The war is at home and the enemy is poverty<br>
    They say, “It’s a part of good ‘ol US Democracy”<br>
    Millions die every day from a broken system<br>
    While the rulers laugh at their fallen kingdom<br>
    <br>
    Fight to overpower<br>
    Fight to survive<br>
    Fight for a better world<br>
    End the capitalist suicide<br>
    <br>
    Our fight is against the hoarders of capital<br>
    Not those who live in a foreign capitol<br>
    It’s time that we end those full of greed<br>
    A world controlled by the people is what we need<br>
    <br>
    Fight to overpower<br>
    Fight to survive<br>
    Fight for a better world<br>
    End the capitalist suicide<br>
    <br>
    Fight, fight, fight, fight

    </p>

      Because imperialism in its very essence is what transforms men into beasts. It’s what transforms men into blood-thirsty beasts, ready to slit people’s throats, to assassinate and destroy every last image of a revolutionary or a supporter of a regime who had fallen under its boot. Or who had been fighting for his freedom.

    Plants rely on the help of others in their community to disperse their seeds - be it wind (as with a samara - maple, elm, ash, etc), water (cattail, coconut), animal ingestion (raspberries, banana), animal transport (burrs, hitchhikers), or human horticulture. Likewise, it's up to the global community to learn about and spread 'seeds of change' planted/growing around the world. International solidarity forever!

    I tried to express the feeling of searching for a beginning, and the forgetting of loneliness in search for collective liberation. The title is a reference to this image of a pin which I found on tumblr years ago, it has been my profile picture on and off online ever since.
