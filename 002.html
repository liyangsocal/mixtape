<!-- INTRODUCTION TO LINER NOTES -->
	<div id="body-text">
		<p>Inspired by the urgent and ever-growing international solidarity movement against imperialism, we called on musicians to respond to the theme of seeds. As we witness increasing repression and fascism around the world, our network meditated on the growth, continuation, and multiplicity that sustains us and our movements.</p>

		<p>This project began as part of Liyang Network’s Defend the Defenders campaign, a response to this increasing repression of environmental and human rights defenders and advocates in the Philippines in the last four years. The campaign supported targeted activists in Mindanao from diverse groups - farmers, workers, Indigenous Peoples, and women - who are all part of the broad-based movement to free the country from foreign domination, and develop it sustainably for the Filipino people.</p>

		<p>Despite the Philippine government’s best efforts, the impacts of what has been built will not be extinguished, and defenders will continue to wage the struggle for land and life. Tied to the land, we find that seeds can represent the planting and re-planting done both literally and figuratively to win people’s struggles. Long live land defenders! Mabuhay!</p>

	</div>
	<br>

	<div id="emphasized-text">
		All proceeds of this mixtape go to Liyang Network’s ongoing work to sustain those on the frontlines of land, environmental, and human rights defense in Mindanao, Philippines.

<!-- LIYANG BIOGRAPHY -->
	<div id="body-text">
		<i>Liyang Network is a local to global advocacy network that amplifies the calls to action of frontline environmental and human rights defenders in Mindanao, Philippines. Originally founded in 2019 in UCCP Haran evacuation center Mindanao, it was born out of a direct request from our primary community partner, Sabokahan Unity of Lumad Women to form a network to bring together all of their international supporters in order to uplift and advocate for the calls of the Lumad people. Since then, we have established an overseas chapter in the US, which mobilizes people nationally in support of the calls of communities in Mindanao. Liyang U.S.A. currently has 3 regional organizing committees which focus on making connections with local issues in Northern California, Southern California, and Western Massachusetts; we also have members across the country and internationally. Since our founding, Liyang has expanded our advocacy work to include peasants and agri-workers in Mindanao, in addition to our work supporting Lumad communities.</i>

    The track is both about a grasshopper that dies out in the grassy fields and transitions into an eternal blade of grass. Simultaneously, the lyrics explore the death of an elder in the community and their transition into the ancestral realm. We see that both are one-in-the-same, grasshopper and elder, as they have much to teach us albeit in different ways, and both ultimately join the eternal realm all the same.

    <b>Song Story: Mountain Song with Ahma</b><br>
    by Umi Hsu<br>
    <br>
    Flowers, flowers, I love, I strive<br>
    Flower flowers, I sing, I thrive<br>
    <br>
    As a small child, I spent many moments with my paternal grandmother <i>Ahma</i> (“grandmother” in Taiwanese) learning how she lived life and made beautiful things. Ahma used to sing to her plants while watering them. Humming melodies ranging from Japanese <i>enka</i> to Western folk and classical genres, Ahma sang while I daydreamed. Morning light cast into the living room danced with shadows of plants and crawling creatures. Dust floated amidst urban air. In the bustling metropolis of Taipei, these moments of quietude in this city were precious.<br>
    <br>
    How did I get here, flowers<br>
    How did they get here, flowers<br>
    Language that you speak, I speak<br>
    Game that you play, I play<br>
    <br>
    Ahma was a professor of ikebana-style flower arranging . She grew up in Longtan Township, a small town south of Taipei during the Japanese Occupation Era, between the World Wars. As a kid, she played with the children of Japanese teachers at the local elementary school where her mother worked preparing student lunches. She learned and mastered Japanese, the language of the colonial government in Taiwan during the first half of the 20th century. When she finished elementary school, Ahma’s school principal recommended her for work at a highly-ranked Japanese official’s mansion in Taipei. Ahma told me that she loved city life. The colonial city was cosmopolitan. Symphony in the park. City lights. Then the War broke out.<br>
    <br>
    Wandering the streets in <i>Tai-Ba</i><sup>1</sup><br>
    Musing the world in <i>koen</i><sup>2</sup><br>
    Cities I’ve walked in; bombs I’ve dodged<br>
    Lessons I’ve learned; and wars I’ve fought<br>
    <br>
    I love the sound of Hakka. It’s the language of migrants originally from central China. I didn’t grow up speaking it. Even my dad knows only a few phrases. I can’t hear the Hakka language in my head but in how I imagine it, it sounds melodious. Speaking Hakka is like singing. I long for the sound of it.<br>
    <br>
    My grandparents spoke Hakka as code if they didn’t want their kids to know something.<br>
    They also learned to hide this language from the government under the martial regime and to speak it strategically only with friends they trust. For more than fifty years, Hakka language and culture was marginalized by the dominant Mandarin culture.<br>
    <br>
    Post-martial-law Taiwan embraces ethnic difference. Taiwan’s multicultural heritage is now a part of its character made to be re-experienced by youngsters and consumed by visitors and tourists. There are Hakka museums and Hakka language schools in towns and cities where there used to be Hakka ethnic enclaves.<br>
    <br>
    On a trip to Longtan in 2012, I visited Ahma’s elementary school. On the tiled walls of the building facade, next to the giant subtropical trees, I spotted didactic language lessons in Hakka. It was summer time. There were a couple of children playing in the playground. I asked them to recite the words in Hakka. They enunciated the words for me, a semi-foreigner with an iPhone 3.<br>
    <br>
    Sango, lai cang sango<sup>3</sup><br>
    Sango, lai cang sango<br>
    <br>
    Near the end of her life, Ahma suffered memory loss from Alzheimer's. My goodbye to Ahma lasted a long time. Saying goodbye is an art of call and response. When I was writing this song, I was imagining Hakka tea farmers singing “mountain songs” <i>(sango)</i> to keep each other company while working in the fields on the rolling hills. The tea farmers let the echoes of each lyric ring out across the mountain, before they respond with another lyric. They play with the space of the canyon and the distance between the caller and the responder. Out, around, and then back. “Flowers” is my mountain song with Ahma.<br>
    <br>
    Sango, lai cang sango<br>
    Sango, lai cang sango<br>
    <br>

    <b>Lyrics:</b><br>
    This porch I'm on right now is all mine<br>
    And I'm filled with cherry smoke<br>
    Adorned in ash and completely incoherent<br>
    Yeah, its just like how I dreamed it.<br>
    <br>
    And all I want is a field of grass.<br>
    So high, that nobody could pass.<br>
    And the sun's so low, that I pay taxes on it.<br>
    But live like I don't want it.<br>
    <br>
    Cause I don't need to tell everyone, everything.<br>
    Sometimes, sometimes...<br>
    My mouth gets a little untied.<br>
    (Sometimes...)<br>
    <br>
    Right now this porch I'm on is all mine.<br>
    My friends inside the deep deep heat.<br>
    Can these structures ever unwind?<br>
    Their holding everything all the time...<br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, this porch is all mine<br>
    Sometimes, it belongs to you...<br>

    As we attempt to liberate food, we learn that supermarkets are developing facial recognition and license plate software to track your location and identity. When you verify for unemployment, the UI app requires a face scan. At airports, they use biometric data to scan your face instead of a passport. When testing for COVID-19, BioThermal imaging scans your face to read your temperature and heart rate. Instagram starts showing advertisements about a product discussed in our verbal conversations. During protests, drones and cameras scan freedom fighters to redtag, arrest, and murder us off.

    You walk by the woods and you kill the trees<br>
    I walked right by you and killed the weak<br>
    <br>
    I've opened up my eyes<br>
    So don't look so surprised<br>
    The contract you have signed<br>
    Has sentenced you to die<br>
    <br>
    Sinful greed shown in action<br>
    Subtracted masses from the fraction<br>
    No remorse or hospitality<br>
    gore galore or more fatalities<br>
    <br>
    Chills that shake you to the Bone<br>
    The sweat drips down and you feel cold<br>
    Agonizing screams that you can't hold<br>
    Pestilence is in your fucking home<br>
    <br>

    <p>
    I wrote this song with the sole purpose of planting the seeds of resistance in the minds of people by showing how global imperialism works and how it affects Americans domestically. There is no such thing as art for art’s sake in our world currently and so I use my skills and art to help provoke listeners into asking these tough questions about our society.

    <b>Lyrics:</b><br>
    Killing kids abroad by the orders of a fascist<br>
    Those with the money think it's fantastic<br>
    People like me and people like you<br>
    Run from bombs like its a normal thing to do<br>
    The war is at home and the enemy is poverty<br>
    They say, “It’s a part of good ‘ol US Democracy”<br>
    Millions die every day from a broken system<br>
    While the rulers laugh at their fallen kingdom<br>
    <br>
    Fight to overpower<br>
    Fight to survive<br>
    Fight for a better world<br>
    End the capitalist suicide<br>
    <br>
    Workers fighting for their rights at home<br>
    Get crushed under the weight of a pig’s boot<br>
    People like me and people like you<br>
    Just wanting some basic human decency<br>
    The war is at home and the enemy is poverty<br>
    They say, “It’s a part of good ‘ol US Democracy”<br>
    Millions die every day from a broken system<br>
    While the rulers laugh at their fallen kingdom<br>
    <br>
    Fight to overpower<br>
    Fight to survive<br>
    Fight for a better world<br>
    End the capitalist suicide<br>
    <br>
    Our fight is against the hoarders of capital<br>
    Not those who live in a foreign capitol<br>
    It’s time that we end those full of greed<br>
    A world controlled by the people is what we need<br>
    <br>
    Fight to overpower<br>
    Fight to survive<br>
    Fight for a better world<br>
    End the capitalist suicide<br>
    <br>
    Fight, fight, fight, fight

    </p>

    <p>
      Because imperialism in its very essence is what transforms men into beasts. It’s what transforms men into blood-thirsty beasts, ready to slit people’s throats, to assassinate and destroy every last image of a revolutionary or a supporter of a regime who had fallen under its boot. Or who had been fighting for his freedom.

    Plants rely on the help of others in their community to disperse their seeds - be it wind (as with a samara - maple, elm, ash, etc), water (cattail, coconut), animal ingestion (raspberries, banana), animal transport (burrs, hitchhikers), or human horticulture. Likewise, it's up to the global community to learn about and spread 'seeds of change' planted/growing around the world. International solidarity forever!

    I tried to express the feeling of searching for a beginning, and the forgetting of loneliness in search for collective liberation. The title is a reference to this image of a pin which I found on tumblr years ago, it has been my profile picture on and off online ever since.
